The goal of this repository is to develop a community knowledge base to collect findings from all students that will help to:

1. Understand some of the theoretical material in a better way
2. Discover new content that is beneficial to the learning of many students
3. Have a jetson cheat sheet of sorts that can be reference for future classes and projects
